:wave: Hi! I'm Oliver, a self-taught programmer interested in distributed systems.

I started programming when I was 11 and I have around 12 years of professional experience.

I've previously worked at [Aragon](https://aragon.org), [Billy's Billing](https://billy.dk), [Paperflow](https://paperflow.com/) and contributed to [1Hive](https://1hive.org).

Here is an overview of what's currently top of mind for me.
